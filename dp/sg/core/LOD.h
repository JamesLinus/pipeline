      /*! \brief Distance-based level of detail class.
       *  \par Namespace: dp::sg::core
       *  \remarks This class is a special kind of a group containing different 
       *  representations of the same object as well as some range information. 
       *  The representations include different levels of detail, meaning 
       *  that the first child is the best and most precise representation 
       *  of the object, the second child is of lower resolution, and so on.
       *  The current implementation determines the distance between the 
       *  camera and the given center point of the object (dist). The distance 
       *  is compared against the ranges and the corresponding range defines 
       *  the LOD representation to use.\n
       *  \n
       *  It works like this:\n
       *  \code
       *  IF (dist < ranges[0])                    THEN activeChild = 0
       *  ELSE IF (ranges[i-1] < dist < ranges[i]) THEN activeChild = i
       *  ELSE IF (dist > ranges[LASTRANGE])       THEN activeChild = LASTRANGE+1
       *  \endcode
       *  \n
       *  You should provide <b>n</b> ranges and <b>n+1</b> children. 
       *  If you specify too few ranges, the extra children will never 
       *  be used. If you instead provide too few children, the last child will be 
       *  used for all the extra ranges.\n
       *  \n
       *  In some cases you do not want to draw something on the last (infinite)
       *  level. In this case, simply add an empty Group node at the lowest resolution level.
       *  The same applies to the highest resolution level if you want geometry that is too  
       *  near to the camera to disappear. */
